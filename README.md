DTSA 5301 Final Project 1: NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report

## Project Purpose

This is the Final Project for the course DTSA 5301: Data Science as a Field. We are demonstrating our ability to complete all steps in the data science process by creating a reproducible report on NYPD Shooting Incident Data.

## Project Instructions

Create a video in .mp4 format in which you present your "NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report" from Week 3 in ten minutes or less. The project should be NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) from the website: https://catalog.data.gov/datase. You may re-use what you did for the assignments in Week 3 if you want to. Be sure to use the presentation skills we discussed in the lectures.

Put your reproducible document in your github account and provide a link to that document. Your peers should be able to download and knit your document without errors.

## Grading Criteria

1. Did the presenter maintain good eye contact?
2. Did the presenter speak clearly?
3. Was the presenter engaging and enthusiastic about their topic?
4. Was the presentation organized in a logical sequence?
5. Did the presenter make effective use of visualizations?
6. Were the slides shown informative?

## About Data

This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website.

## Question of Interest

My objective is to determine whether any of the demographics of the victim (age, sex, or race) can be used to predict if a shooting was fatal.
